# 🎨 ArtFlow – Neural Style Transfer with VGG19

ArtFlow is a computer vision project that applies artistic style transfer to images using deep learning. It blends the content of a photograph with the style of a painting (or any artistic image) using a pre-trained VGG19 model — producing stunning, high-resolution stylized artwork.

## 🖌️ Key Features

- **Content + Style Fusion:** Transfers brushstrokes, textures, and color palettes from one image to another.
- **Custom Style/Content Inputs:** Supports user-uploaded images for both style and content.
- **Optimized Loss Functions:** Balances content loss and style loss using Gram matrix techniques.
- **Batch Processing (Optional):** Apply style to multiple images in one go.
